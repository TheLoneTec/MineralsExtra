## Minerals: A rimworld mod for the [Hardcore SK project](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK)

![](About/Preview.jpg)


**This mod is an expansion of the "Minerals" Mod and the "Minerals" mod be enabled and must come before in the loading order.**

## Static minerals

These are randomly spawned when a map is created and are never respawned in a given map.

```{r}
print_minerals("Defs/ThingsDefs_Minerals/StaticMinerals.xml",
               parent_xml_paths = "../Minerals/Defs/ThingsDefs_Minerals/StaticMinerals.xml")
```


## Installation

You can download the current development version by clicking the green "clone or download" button near the top of this page. You can also download specific "stable" releases [here](https://github.com/zachary-foster/MineralsExtra/releases), although they will probably not be updated too often. Once you have downloaded the mod, uncompress the file and up the folder in the `Mods` folder of you rimworld installation.

## To xml modders and potential contributers:

This mod is set up so that new minerals, both static and dynamic, can be added and configured using only XML changes.
Adding:

```
<ThingDef ParentName="StaticMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

or

```
<ThingDef ParentName="DynamicMineralBase">
		<defName>MyNewMineral</defName>
    ...
</ThingDef>
```

to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals` will cause a new mineral to be added to the game.

To add a mineral: 

* Copy the `ThingDef` for an existing mineral that is most similar to the one you want to make. Modify the XML how you want and add it to an XML file in `Defs/ThingDefs_Minerals`. Make sure to change the `defName`.
* Create textures for the new mineral and add to them to `Textures/Things/Mineral` in the same format as the others there.
* If you want to have you changes added to this mod for others to use, consider [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). I welcome contributions!


## Ideas for future work


### Mineral types

#### Sand dunes

Appear near sand and grow when windy, shrink otherwise.

#### Ash drifts

Appear near burnt things and grow when windy, shrink otherwise.

#### Fossils

Appear in sedimentary rocks.
Can be used as gemstones.


### Events

#### Volcanic ash fall

"A nearby volcano has erupted and is raining down hot ash over this region. Watch out for fires."

For 2-5 days, light drops to 60% and drifts of ash slowly accumulate, slowing travel.
There is a grey filter effect.
Fires randomly start.
Only occurs when within 3 map tiles from a volcanic area (optional?).
Lasts 2-5 days. 

#### Haboob

"A giant dust cloud is heading this way! Best take cover."

Only occurs in dry biomes (chance based on precip of map tile).
Starts at one edge of the map and moves a little faster than most pawns can.
Movement is slow and almost no visability.
Drifts of sand slowy accumulate.
Pawns not under roofs have a chance to develop asthma. 
Lasts 0.5 to 1 days.
